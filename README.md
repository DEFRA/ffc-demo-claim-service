# FFC Demo Claim Service

Digital service mock to claim public money in the event property subsides into mine shaft.  The claim service receives claim data and if doesnâ€™t already exist saves it in a Postgresql database table.  It also publishes events to message queues that a new claim has been received.

# Prerequisites

- Node v10+
- Access to a PostgreSQL database
- Access to an AMQP 1.0 compatible message queue service

# How to run tests

A convenience script is provided to run automated tests in a containerised environment:

```
scripts/test
```

This runs tests via a `docker-compose run` command. If tests complete successfully, all containers, networks and volumes are cleaned up before the script exits. If there is an error or any tests fail, the associated Docker resources will be left available for inspection.

Alternatively, the same tests may be run locally via npm:

```
npm run test
```

# Running the application

The application is designed to run as a container via Docker Compose or Kubernetes (with Helm).

## Using Docker Compose

A set of convenience scripts are provided for local development and running via Docker Compose.

```
# Build service containers
scripts/build

# Start the service and attach to running containers (press `ctrl + c` to quit)
scripts/start

# Stop the service and remove Docker volumes and networks created by the start script
scripts/stop
```

Any arguments provided to the build and start scripts are passed to the Docker Compose `build` and `up` commands, respectively. For example:

```
# Build without using the Docker cache
scripts/build --no-cache

# Start the service without attaching to containers
scripts/start --detach
```

This service depends on an external Docker network named `ffc-demo` to communicate with other services running alongside it. The start script will automatically create the network if it doesn't exist and the stop script will remove the network if no other containers are using it.

The external network is declared in a secondary Docker Compose configuration (referenced by the above scripts) so that this service can be run in isolation without creating an external Docker network.

## Using Kubernetes

The service has been developed with the intention of running on Kubernetes in production.  A helm chart is included in the `.\helm` folder. For development, it is simpler to develop using Docker Compose than to set up a local Kubernetes environment. See above for instructions.

Running via Helm requires a local AMQP message broker and Postgres database to be installed and setup with the credentials defined in the [values.yaml](./helm/values.yaml).

Convenience scripts are provided which deploy all dependencies and the service into the current Helm/Kubernetes context. These should be used to test local changes to Helm charts:

```
# Build service containers
scripts/build

# Deploy to current Kubernetes context
scripts/helm/install

# Remove from current Kubernetes context
scripts/helm/delete
```

### Accessing the pod

The ffc-demo-claim-service is not exposed via an endpoint within Kubernetes.

The deployment may be accessed by forwarding a port from a pod.
First find the name of the pod by querying the namespace, i.e.

`kubectl get pods --namespace ffc-demo-claim-service-pr5`

This will list the full name of all the pods in the namespace. Forward the pods exposed port 3003
to a local port using the name returned from the previous command, i.e.

`kubectl port-forward --namespace ffc-demo-claim-service-pr5 ffc-demo-claim-service-8b666f545-g477t  3003:3003`

Once the port is forwarded a tool such as [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) can be used to access the API at http://localhost:3003/submit.
Sample valid JSON that can be posted is:
```
{
  "claimId": "MINE123",
  "propertyType": "business",
  "accessible": false,
  "dateOfSubsidence": "2019-07-26T09:54:19.622Z",
  "mineType": ["gold"]
}
```
 Alternatively curl can be used locally to send a request to the end point, i.e.

```
curl  -i --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --request POST \
  --data '{ "claimId": "MINE123", "propertyType": "business",  "accessible": false,   "dateOfSubsidence": "2019-07-26T09:54:19.622Z",  "mineType": ["gold"] }' \
  http://localhost:3003/submit
```

### Probes

The service has both an Http readiness probe and an Http liveness probe configured to receive at the below end points.

Readiness: `/healthy`
Liveness: `/healthz`

# Build Pipeline

The [azure-pipelines.yaml](azure-pipelines.yaml) performs the following tasks:
- Runs unit tests
- Publishes test result
- Pushes containers to the registry tagged with the PR number or release version
- Deletes PR deployments, containers, and namepace upon merge

Builds will be deployed into a namespace with the format `ffc-demo-claim-service-{identifier}` where `{identifier}` is either the release version, the PR number, or the branch name.

A detailed description on the build pipeline and PR work flow is available in the [Defra Confluence page](https://eaflood.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/FFCPD/pages/1281359920/Build+Pipeline+and+PR+Workflow)
