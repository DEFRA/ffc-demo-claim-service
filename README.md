# Prerequisites
Node v10+
PostgreSQL
Message queue - amqp protocol

# Running the application
The application is designed to run as a container via Docker Compose or Kubernetes (with Helm).

A convenience script is provided to run via Docker Compose:

`scripts/start`

This will create the required `mine-support` network before starting the service so that it can communicate with other Mine Support services running alongside it through docker-compose. The script will then attach to the running service, tailing its logs and allowing the service to be brought down by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

# Kubernetes
The service has been developed with the intention of running in Kubernetes.  A helm chart is included in the `.\helm` folder.

# How to run tests
Unit tests are written in Lab and can be run with the following command:

`npm run test`
